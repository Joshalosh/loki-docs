Before deciding which wallet you want to use you must first know what you want the wallet for.

If you want to host and operate a Loki Service Node there is only one wallet that offers the ability to register a Service Node, which is the command-line interface wallet (CLI) which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases).

To better understand how to prepare, register and maintain a Service Node check out this guide [here](../ServiceNodes/SNFullGuide.md).

### Staking to a Service Node as a contributor.

Do you have atleast 25% of a Loki Service Node staking requirement and want to contribute to a Service Node pool?

If so you will want to either use the:

- Graphical user interface wallet (GUI) or,

- Command-line interface wallet (CLI)

If you rarely use the terminal or command line we would suggest to perform your stake through the GUI wallet which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-gui/releases) alternatively if you would like to perform the stake on the CLI wallet you can download it [here](https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases).
